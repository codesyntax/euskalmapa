Euskalmapa
==========

This code was used to build the site http://www.euskalmapa.com/  back in 2010.

Basically what it does is use Mapnik to generate high zoom level tiles with texts in basque for the whole world using name:eu (eu is the code for basque) and in our Basque Country area. For the rest of the world, we are using default OSM tiles.
